I'm a PhD student in Medical Science at the University of Toronto, specializing in neuroscience. My research focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying perception and attention in psychiatric populations. I use a range of methods—including EEG, MRI, and non-invasive brain stimulation—to investigate how brain structure and function support visual and cognitive processes.

Under the supervision of Dr. Jamie Feusner at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, I study structural and functional connectivity between the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, particularly as they relate to face, body, and object perception in the context of body image disturbance. My broader goal is to translate insights from clinical cognitive neuroscience into novel tools and interventions that improve mental health care.

Outside the lab, I enjoy mentoring students and exploring the intersection of health and technology—especially through photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and wearable devices.
